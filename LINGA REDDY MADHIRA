Boehm's spiral model [Boehm, 1987] IS an activity-centered life cycle model that was
devised to address the source of weaknesses in the waterfall model, in particular, to
accommodate infrequent change during the software development. It is based on the same
activities as the waterfall model; however, it adds several activities such as risk management,
reuse, and prototypmg to each activity. These extended activities are called cycles or rounds.
